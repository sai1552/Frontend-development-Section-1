    <h4>How Does the Internet Actually Work?</h4>
    <li><p>So what exactly is the Internet?
        A lot of people think it's a cloud, something that's hanging around in the sky, it's super complex, super difficult to understand, but actually, that's not it at all. The Internet is pretty simple. All it is is just a long piece of wire, and wire connects different computers to each other. So you might have one computer that's in London and another one that's in Seattle, and they can talk to each other and transfer data through this giant wire. Now, some of these computers attached the Internet have a very special job, they have to be online 24/7, ready to serve you all the data and files that you are requesting when you try to access a website, and these are called servers. And what they do is they serve you all the data and files you need to be able to access and interact with certain websites. So, these computers are called Servers, and any computer that a user would use to access the Internet is called a client. Now, you can imagine a web server as a giant library that's open 24/7, and you can go in there at any hour of the day and say, I want to see Google's home page or I want to see the latest posts on TechCrunch and would be able to serve you with all the files and data you would need to be able to view whatever website you want. Now, as you can imagine, if there's a library that's big enough to house all of these websites, then it's going to be pretty difficult to quickly locate the thing that you want out of this giant library, right?

So how is this problem solved on the Internet?     
       Well, let's say that you're sitting at home on your computer and you type in google.com because you want to head over to the main Google home page. Well, what happens behind the scenes, is that your browser will send that message to your ISP or your Internet service provider. So these are the people who you pay to be able to access the Internet. If you live in the US, that will be AT&T or Comcast, and if you're in the UK, that would be something like BT or TalkTalk. Now the message that you're sending the ISP is I want to see google.com and the ISP will then relay that message to something called a DNS server, which stands for a Domain Name System Server. And a DNS server is essentially just a souped up phone book. And what happens when you make that request through your browser is the DNS server will look up in its database to find the exact IP address of that website that you're trying to access. And every single computer that's connected to the Internet has an IP address. It's kind of like a postal code for your computer so that when people need to send and receive files on the Internet, each computer can be located and contacted using their unique IP address. And once the DNS server finds that IP address, it will send it back to your browser through the ISP, over the internet, then you can make a direct request to that address. And what lives at that IP address is of course the Google servers, and they'll be able to send you back all the files and data you need to be able to view the Google home page.

      Now you can try this for yourself to look up the IP address of the Google home page. Head over to this website, nslookup.io and type in google.com and they should show you the exact IP address of the Google servers that you can access. So if you copy it and paste it into a new tab, then you'll be able to replicate that process and see the Google home page show up. So to summarize, the Internet is just a bunch of wires that connects up different computers, but it's just on a much bigger scale, connecting up all the computers in the world.

But what about the oceans?
       I hear you ask. Well, that's one of the coolest things. There are these massive undersea cables connecting all the continents on Earth. And if you head over to submarinecablemap.com, you can see all of these cables and see the ones that connect you up to the Internet. And these undersea cables are massive, consisting of hundreds of fiber optic fibers, each of them using lasers to transmit up to 400 gigabytes of data per second. This is a cross-section of one of the cables that runs to New Zealand.
                 It's an absolute marvel of modern technology, and it looks really beautiful, don't you think? And to think that every single time we load up a web page or click on a button on a website, behind the scenes was sending signals that navigates all of this crazy underwater and above water wires and all I need is just an IP address. And through tiny electric signals, traveling at the speed of light through the oceans and halfway around the world, in a matter of milliseconds, I get to view my favorite websites, and that is how awesome the Internet is. And we're going to be taking it to build our own websites and web apps. And to be able to do that, we first have to understand how exactly do websites work.

<h4>How Do Websites Actually Work?</h4>
<li><p>how websites actually work and the role of the browser in rendering web pages. She revisits concepts from the previous lesson, like how the internet connects client and server computers, with DNS servers acting like a phonebook to look up IP addresses. When we access a website, we receive three types of files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure and content, like text, images, and buttons. CSS controls the style and appearance, such as the colors and shapes of elements. JavaScript gives functionality, enabling interactions like sending emails or posting on social media. Angela explains that these three files work together to form a modern website, with the browser loading them to display content, style it, and add interactivity. She demonstrates this process using Google’s homepage, showing how inspecting and editing elements in Chrome Developer Tools allows us to change text on a page, such as renaming the “Google Search” button to “Angela Search.” However, these changes are temporary and only apply locally. Angela encourages learning how to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and host websites that can be customized in any way, promising more lessons ahead to help build real websites for the internet.</p></li>
<h4>How to Get the Most Out of the Course</h4>
<li><p>Welcome to the course! After thousands of students have taken this course, I’ve compiled some of the top tips from the most successful students to help you make the most of your time here. One important tip is that each lesson is designed to take about 10 minutes. Instead of trying to type along with the tutorial, I recommend watching the video to understand what’s happening and the purpose of the code, rather than rushing to type it out. Afterward, go to your computer and replicate what was taught. This method helps you understand the material deeply, rather than just copying code. Remember, we’re learning programming, not how to type fast, so take your time to grasp the concepts. Another useful tip is to take notes as you watch. A simple note-taking method like the Cornell notes system can be really effective. After writing down your notes, review them, highlight key points or questions, and summarize the lesson in your own words. If the video is too fast or slow, you can adjust the playback speed to suit your needs. However, avoid skipping modules, as the course is carefully structured to build upon each concept. If you find certain lessons difficult, try to review and practice more, but don’t hesitate to revisit challenging topics after a break, as concepts often become clearer with time. Remember, learning new skills takes practice, and you will encounter challenges along the way. Don’t be discouraged when you get stuck, as it’s a normal part of programming. Professional developers spend a lot of time debugging, so when you face problems, use tools like Google and Stack Overflow to find solutions. The feeling of solving a problem after struggling with it is one of the best experiences, and it’s through these struggles that you improve. Stay persistent, practice, and enjoy the learning process. I’m excited to be part of your journey and look forward to your success!

<h4>How to Get Help When You're Stuck</h4>
<li><p>At some point, you’ve probably encountered a tutorial or lesson online, and inevitably, you’ve gotten stuck. It’s an inevitable part of the learning process, and it’s something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about. When I get stuck, I try to see it as a challenge because solving it usually comes with a huge sense of satisfaction and growth. Over the years, I've taught over 100,000 students and seen various struggles. So, here’s a framework you can use to get unstuck when programming. First, evaluate the difference between your expectations and the reality of what’s happening with your code. When you run your code, think about what you expected to happen versus what actually happened and try to figure out the cause of the discrepancy. Mistakes like typos or installation issues will inevitably lead to errors, often with cryptic error messages. You can usually figure out what’s going wrong by searching those messages on Google, and you’ll often find helpful solutions on Stack Overflow. If you don’t know about Stack Overflow yet, it’ll soon become your best friend. Developers use it daily, and it’s a key part of the workflow. If that doesn’t help, rewatch the part of the video where your code broke to check for typos or small mistakes. Comparing your code to the completed project at the end of each lesson can also help you spot mistakes. If you’re still stuck, check the Q&A section under the lesson to see if others have encountered similar issues. If not, ask a question with as much detail as possible, including what you expected, what actually happened, screenshots of your code, and any errors from the debug console. Including timestamps from the video can also help me answer your question faster. To make it easier, you can take screenshots using shortcuts: on Windows, press Windows + Shift + S, and on Mac, press Command + Shift + 4. Don’t worry if you get stuck—everyone does, even experienced developers. I’ve spent days trying to find bugs, only to realize they were caused by something as small as a misplaced comma. Getting stuck and solving it is a crucial part of the learning journey, and I’m here to help!
